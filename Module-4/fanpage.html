    <h2>Bio</h2>
    <p>
        Seoul-based K-Pop girl group Twice features members from Korea, Japan, and Taiwan performing bright, catchy pop tunes. Their debut Twicetagram topped the Korean, Taiwanese, and U.S. World charts upon release in 2017. In 2020, they made their first appearance on the Billboard 200 with their ninth EP, More & More. Months later, they bested that showing with their sophomore full-length, Eyes Wide Open.

        Formed by JYP Entertainment in 2015 on the reality show Sixteen, Twice is comprised of leader and main vocalist Jihyo Park, Nayeon Im, Jeongyeon Yoo, Dahyun Kim, and Chaeyoung Son from South Korea; Momo Hirai, Sana Minatozaki, and Mina Myoui from Japan; and Tzuyu Chou from Tainan, Taiwan. The nine women made their debut in late 2015 with mini-album The Story Begins, which featured the single "Like Ooh-Ahh." Months later, they issued Page Two, which saw Twice continue to climb the charts in their three home countries and the United States. In late 2016, third mini-album Twicecoaster: Lane 1 was released, followed by a quick reissue titled Twicecoaster: Lane 2, which peaked in the Top Five of the Korean, Taiwanese, and Billboard World charts upon release in early 2017. The Twicecoaster releases spawned the hit singles "TT" and "Knock Knock." Their fourth mini-album, Signal, arrived that spring. It became their third Korean and fourth Taiwanese chart-topper, peaking at number three on the Billboard World chart. Later that summer, they followed the success of Signal with a push into the Japanese-language market. #Twice included Japanese re-recordings of their biggest singles and was the first time Twice charted in New Zealand. Led by the single "Likey," they released their debut full-length, Twicetagram, in October of that year, topping a number of charts including Korea, Taiwan, and the U.S. World Albums. The single "Candy Pop" followed in February 2018. The chart-topping hit landed on sophomore full-length — and first Japanese-language effort — BDZ, which was released in September. In the Korean market, they also issued their fifth mini-album, What Is Love? (and its subsequent reissue, Summer Nights), and the chart-topping sixth mini-album Yes or Yes.
